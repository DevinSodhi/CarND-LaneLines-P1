Overview
---
A beginner's attempt at the lane line project for the Udacity nano degree.
This is the first project that's due.



What i got done

So far, the project just passes the tests for the requirements and not the extra challenges. I started about a month late, so i'm going to catch up a bit before i jump into the project.
